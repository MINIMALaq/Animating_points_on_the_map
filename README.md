# Animating_points_on_the_map
This repo is a combination of Flask and folium to visualize time series data on the  Maps.


The [start_points_sample.txt](https://github.com/MINIMALaq/Animating_points_on_the_map/blob/main/start_points_sample.txt) is a geojson based on open NYC Bike [data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)


To run the code: <br>

`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`python folium_flask.py`  <br>
Then you need to open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in our brower and see the animating of start point of bikes on the map.
